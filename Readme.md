This project is created to demonstrate how to create shared libraries in different languages and use them from Ruby and Python

Note that exit "Bye" callbacks order is different than the order in which libraries are loaded and "Hello" functions are called. That's because different approaches are used:

- Ruby, Python and Java use their own `at_exit`/`atexit`/`addShutdownHook` hooks; Ruby triggers Python's and Java's hooks inside its own
- Rust, C, C++, D, Go, Swift, Zig, both LLVM examples, use C stdlib `atexit`; they aren't called in the reverse order because they are registered across different shared libraries
- Nim uses it's own std hook, which I suppose also uses the C one under the hood
- Crystal and Julia use their own standart hooks triggered by runtime shutdown, which is done by finalizers called in `dlclose`
- C# doesn't have a standart approach and uses a custom solution triggered as the previous ones
- Haskell doesn't have a standart approach and uses C stdlib `atexit`, runtime shutdown is also deferred into `atexit`

You can use `poetry` instead of `pipenv`.

You can use `pipenv run inv` or `poetry run inv` or `poetry run poe build` instead of `bundle exec rake`. All these commands use [`tasks.py`](/tasks.py) for [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) - and [Poe the Poet](https://poethepoet.natn.io/index.html), configured in the `[tool.poe.tasks]` section of the [`pyproject.toml`](/pyproject.toml) for the last one - instead of Rake and [`Rakefile`](/Rakefile).

# Todo:
 - Fix Haskell's `build.sh` (copies a wrong `.so`), unify Zig's (symlink)
 - Hide unnecessary exported symbols: `nm -D */lib*.so | grep -Pe '\s(bye|init|exit)_'`
 <!-- - Check `NO_COLOR` everywhere (only Crystal, Swift, RubyLLVM and Ruby implementations do that) -->
 <!-- - Check `tty?` everywhere (only Swift implementation does that) -->
 <!-- - Check for truecolor support and fallback to ansi/ascii -->
 <!-- - Fix Crystal - impl exit_crystal to make `at_exit` work, get rid of [init](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32701238/13500870) -->
 - Get rid of `-init`/`-fini`
 - Python atexit from pycall (use Py_Finalize)
 - [`Ocaml`](https://ocaml.org/manual/5.0/native.html)
